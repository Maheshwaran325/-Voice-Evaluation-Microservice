Let's work together to refine your delivery.\n\nRegarding pronunciation, it appears some words like \"Are,\" \"is,\" \"hands,\" \"products,\" and \"deliver\" might benefit from a little extra practice. Consider listening to how these words are pronounced in audio dictionaries or by native speakers to improve clarity. While the high Words Per Minute of 171724 suggest that you should take your time, focusing on those words first would be great. Be conscious of adding pauses in between segments of your speech; there is an indication that the pause count is low.\n\nKeep up the fantastic work and practice these small refinements, and you'll see significant improvements in your public speaking!\n"}}
